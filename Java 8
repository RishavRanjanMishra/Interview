What are the main features introduced in Java 8?
:-
  Lambda Expressions
  Stream API
  Functional Interfaces
  Optional
  Default Methods
  Date and Time API
  Methods References.

Lambda Expressions is an anonymous function(a function without name).

Stream API is used to process collections of data in functional programming style.
It is Immutable(not modify).
Improve code readability and conciseness.
Support parallel execution for better performance.
Encourages functional programming.

Functional Interfaces have exactly one abstract method and are used in lambda expressions.

Optional is used to avoid NullPointerException.

Default Methods is used to add default implementations in interfaces.
Example :-
        Interfaces MyInterface {
		  default void show() {
		    System.out.println("Default Method");
		  }
	    }

Date and Time API is used to improved handling of dates and times.

Method References is used to simplified syntax for calling methods.
