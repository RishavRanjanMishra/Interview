             :- It provides a set of interfaces and classes to represent and manipulate collections of objects.

Explain the difference between List, Set, and Map.
             List :- It an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.

             Set :- It is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements.

				     Map :- It is a collection of key-value pairs.

ArrayList class?
             :- It is a resizable array implementation of the List interface.
			          It dynamically grows as elements are added.

LinkedList class?
            :- It is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface.
			         It provides fast insertion and deletion but slower random access.

HashSet class?
            :- It is an implementation of the Map interface that uses a hash table for storage.
			         It allows null keys and values and does not guarantee order

TreeSet class?
            :- It is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a Red-Black tree for storage.
			         It provides elements in sorted order.

What is difference between HashMap and HashTable?
            HashMap :- It is not synchronized and allows null keys and values.

			  	  HashTable :- It is synchronized and does not allow null keys or values.

Collections class?
            :- It provides utility methods for working with collections, such as sorting, shuffling, and searching.
