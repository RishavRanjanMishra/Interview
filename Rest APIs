Q.) What are HTTP methods? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Ans:- HTTP methods are used by clients (like browsers or mobile apps) to communicate with servers.
      The most commonly used ones are:-
	      1. GET :-
		    Purpose: To retrieve data from the server.
			Usage: Used to read or fetch resources.
			Example: 
			    GET /users/123 – retrieves user with ID 123.
			    Safe & Idempotent: Yes (doesn’t change data).

		  2. POST :-
		    Purpose: To send data to the server to create a new resource.
			Usage: Used when submitting forms or creating a new record.
			Example:
			    POST /users – creates a new user with data in the request body.
			    Safe & Idempotent: No (can create duplicates if retried).

		 3. PUT :-
		    Purpose: To update or create a resource at a specific URL.
		    Usage: Used to fully update a resource (or create if it doesn't exist).
			Example:
				PUT /users/123 – updates user with ID 123.
				Safe & Idempotent: Idempotent (same result on repeated calls).

		 4. DELETE :-
		    Purpose: To remove a resource from the server.
		    Usage: Used to delete data.
			Example:
				DELETE /users/123 – deletes user with ID 123.
				Safe & Idempotent: Idempotent.
 

Q.) What is idempotency ion REST APIs?
Ans:- Safe to call multiple time without side effects.
      Ex:- GET, PUT are idempotent; POST is not.

Q.) How do you secure REST APIs (JWT, OAuth)?
Ans:- Use JWT (Jason Web Tokens).
      Configure Spring Security with filters and tokens validation.

Q.) Status codes and their meanings?
