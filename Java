The constructor can be defined as the special type of method that is used to initialize the state of an object.

If a class has multiple methods and having same name but different in parameters, It is called Method Overloading.

If a subclass(child class) has same method as declared in parent class, it is called as Method Overriding.

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of the object and showing only the functionality of the user.

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
Ex:- Capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

Getter method is for read and Setter method is for write.

Coupling refers to Information, Knowledge, dependency of another class.
It arises when classes are aware of each other i.e. if a class has details information of another class, then there is strong coupling.

The mutable objects are objects whose value can be changed after initialization. Ex :- Java.util.Date, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, etc.

The immutable objects are objects whose value can not be changed after initialization.
Ex :- All primitive objects, legacy classes, wrapper classes, String class, etc.
